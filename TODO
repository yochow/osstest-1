Comments from Ian Campbell:



I had to manually mkdir a bunch of stuff,

=> mkdir /home/ianc/public_html
=> mkdir /usr/groups/netboot/ianc/osstest
=> mkdir logs



We've previously talked about the need to run the webserver on the same
host and to make the logs available to osstest for the purposes of
detecting the preseed getting loaded. We discussed perhaps using netcat
or something to ring a doorbell from the preseed file.



There's no option to install using VGA rather than serial.

Figuring out what a "job" was and where a list of valid ones was took a
little while. I think you said that in manual mode this basically only
controlled the $ARCH, in which case being able to say -a $ARCH or set an
env var and have it pick a job would be useful. Or give a job as
arch=foo or something.



Pie in the sky stuff I'd like to do, which probably require new ts-foo
stuff. Mostly this is targeted at keeping tabs on the state of Debian
rather than xen-unstable.hg. In any case just FYI.
      * Install packaged version of Xen instead of building it.
      * Install Wheezy instead of Squeeze (Jessie, N+2,...)
      * Test host upgrades
      * Install Debian guests using d-i via netinst, from CD etc.
