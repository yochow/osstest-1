Email reports
=============

osstest's primary output is the email reports to the mailing list,
along with the associated HTML scoreboards.

  Subject: [xen-4.4-testing test] 58975: tolerable trouble: broken/pass - PUSHED
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	  ^^^^^^
       	    branch          |  	  flight  overall outcome         	    |
                            |	       			     	       push mark
 		  always exactly "test"


The overall outcome is preceded by `tolerable' if the there were no
excusable regressions, or `regressions - ' if there were.

The overall outcome is then one of:
   all pass
   FAIL
   ALL FAIL
   trouble: <set of individual job outcomes>


Main mail body listing failed tests
-----------------------------------

The main top part of the body lists test failures.  Each line lists a
failing test step.  These are categorised by how much of problem the
failure is.

Each line looks something like this:

 test-amd64-i386-xl-qemuu-win7-amd64 14 guest-localmigrate.2 fail pass in 58960
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     job                              |    step testid       results
                          step number-'

The results normally start with the result in this flight, and can be
followed by various information about the status of this step in the
history.  Here are some examples:

   fail REGR. vs. 58530

      This step failed just now; whereas it previously passed in the
      baseline (in flight 58530).  This is a regression, which is
      normally blocking.

   fail like 58963

      This step failed just now; but it also failed on the baseline,
      in flight 58963.  So it is not a regression.

   fail never pass

      This step has never passed on this branch and is not a
      regression.

   fail pass in 58863

      This step failed just now; but it passed in 58863 which was
      another test of the same version.  Such failures are not
      blocking.

   fail baseline untested

      The results processor didn't find any executions of this step in
      tests of the baseline version.  So it would not be able to
      detect regressions of this test.  Perhaps the test has been
      recently introduced.

   fail in 58948 pass in 58965
   fail in 58948 like 37628

      The results processor used 58948 (another flight testing the
      just-tested version) to convince itself that some other test is
      failing intermittently.  However, in 58948, this step failed,
      which would be a problem.  But this step passed in 58965, or
      failed in 37628, so it is not a blocker (cf `pass in' and like',
      above).

   broken REGR. vs. 36514

      The step failed and this is probably an indication of a problem
      with the test infrastructure.  Such failures are always regarded
      as regressions because they may mask other problems.

   blocked n/a

      The test step was blocked by a previous failure.  This is not
      regarded as a regression - instead, the underlying failure is
      checked for regression.

   queued
   running
   preparing

      The flight was cancelled before it finished executing.  (Also
      appears if a report is manually requested on a still-running
      flight.)

The flight numbers quoted in these step failure summaries may
sometimes be suffixed with `-bisect' to show that the indicated flight
was part of a bisection attempt, rather than a main test flight.


Email information headers
-------------------------

Test report emails sent by osstest have some extra information in the
email headers, where applicable:

X-Osstest-Failures:
    osstest:test-armhf-armhf-xl-midway:guest-start:fail:heisenbug
    osstest:test-amd64-amd64-xl-rtds:xen-boot:fail:blocked
    ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^
    branch    job                       |      |    |
			      step testid      |    analysis
				               |
				     step status

The `analysis' field may be:

   regression   "Tests which did not succeed and are blocking"
   heisenbug    "Tests which are failing intermittently (not blocking)"
   allowable    "Regressions which are regarded as allowable"
   nonblocking  "Tests which did not succeed, but are not blocking"
   fail         "Tests which did not succeed" (non-regression-test flights)

When using email filtering, you should filter on the relevant From:
line as well as X-Osstest-Failures, as there is nothing in
X-Osstest-Failures identifying the instance.

X-Osstest-Versions-This:
    osstest=cc8b79ce9586d2b0fbddbd4260e876eab1d408d4
X-Osstest-Versions-That:
    osstest=280a18b2b2612174e473a1c1a137ddd47c49aab9
    ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     tree     revision

`This' is the version being tested, and `That' is the baseline.
